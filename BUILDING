Prerequisites:

- Qt 5.0 or later (4.x may work, but YMMV).
- OpenSSL development package (headers and libraries).


Building under Linux:

1. Fix steganodisk.pro to point to your installation of
   OpenSSL.

2.
qmake
make


Bulding under Windows (Visual Studio command-line prompt):

1. Fix steganodisk.pro to point to your installation of
   OpenSSL.

2.
qmake
nmake
(fix compile errors and repeat - I did not test windows builds).

Note that Windows build is incomplete and can only handle
image files. Working with disk devices is not supported yet.
